{% include section.html c="Industry" %}

He put [the 402-Receipts Standard](https://www.402receipts.info/introduction.html) on indefinite hiatus in 2019. 
Of that work, the piece mostly likely to still be of any use is the [RSA Blind Signature](https://github.com/ShapeOfMatter/RSA-Blind-Signature) implementation.

Mako built a deep understanding of php and python during his six years of industry work; this inspired his decision to return to academia.
