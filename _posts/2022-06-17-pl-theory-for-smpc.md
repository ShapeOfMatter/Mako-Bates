description: "Programming Language(s) for automatic verification of Secure Multi-Party Computation implementations"

My primary reseach project this year is to build a language with type system enforcing MPC security.
This is _not_ a language that takes SMPC protocols as primitives; instead it takes communication between parties as its key primative,
and an SMPC scheme such as GMW can be build inside of it and type-checked.

TODO: Write about the work I'm building on top of and some of the key ideas so far.
