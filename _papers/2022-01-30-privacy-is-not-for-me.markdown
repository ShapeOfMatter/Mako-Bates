Much design around security and privacy assumes (and advocates or attempts to enforce) a policy of "one user per account" (or device).
This paper considers a sociological context (working-class women in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) in which that assumption is inappropriate. 
The authors conducted qualitative focus groups with ~200 women in 2017,
attempting to understand how women in South-West Asia perceive and control their privacy on shared mobile phones,
and how the designs of the devices do or do not fulfil the women's expectations.

A bit over half the participants reported sharing mobile devices in their household. 
Devices-sharing seems to be more of a gender issue than a class issue:
"When women had mobile phones, their devices were often viewed as ‘family’ devices."
In some cases the situation was worse than that;
a woman's use of technology was "mediated" by someone else or their phone was routinely checked by someone as a kind of surveillance. 
Participants generally did not view these situations as a violation of their privacy;
instead they viewed "privacy" as a foreign cultural value that was not relevant to them. 
(Privacy as a cultural value was perceived as an artifact of the upper class.)
In contrast to these espoused cultural norms, _all_ respondents reported taking _some_ actions to control privacy on their devices. 

### Highlights

The subject-matter of this paper is _really imporant_. 
It's intuitive that privacy as a cultural value is less common in low-SES contexts; 
validating and unpacking that intuition is important as our own culture's relationship with privacy is evolving
(and competing memetically with other cultures).
I was particularly interested to read about how privacy-protecting behaviors and technology designs play out
in contexts where privacy is explicitly not valued. 
Also, from a professional perspective, n=199 is impressive.
