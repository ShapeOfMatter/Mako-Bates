Way back in 2n 2019 as part of an attempt at an e-cash system, I put together an implementation of the basic RSA Blind Signature algorithm;
that code can be found [here](https://github.com/ShapeOfMatter/RSA-Blind-Signature).

TODO: write up what blind signatures are, how they're different from simple hashes, etc.  
TODO: fix some typos in the documentation of that repo.
