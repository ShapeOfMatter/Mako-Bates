Mako Bates defended [his dissertation](https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/graddis/2101),
on particular techniques for choreographic programming,
in June of 2025,
and is continuing to work with the UVM team as a postdoc through the fall.
During his PhD, he also worked on secure multi-party computation, differential privacy systems, and language design.

_Efficient, Portable, Census-Polymorphic Choreographic Programming._  
with Shun Kashiwa, Syed Jafri, Gan Shen, Lindsey Kuper, and Joseph Near,  
**[presented at PLDI25](https://www.youtube.com/live/YhXlZp45HLs?t=23925s)**.  
[proceedings version](https://doi.org/10.1145/3729296)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[author version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02107)  
- Cutting edge contributions to the theory and implementation of library-level choreographic programming.
- Formalized and implemented novel techniques for programming concurrent protocols.
- Led a team of six researchers in coalescing related findings into a coherent paper.

_MultiChor: Type-safe and efficient choreographies with location-set polymorphism._  
The Haskell package from the above paper, available on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/MultiChor).

_SoK: Usability Studies in Differential Privacy._  
Onyinye Dibia, Prianka Bhattacharjee, Brad Stenger, Steven Baldasty, Mako Bates, Ivoline Ngong, Yuanyuan Feng, and Joseph Near,  
[Published in PoPETs 2025](https://doi.org/10.56553/popets-2025-0162)  
- A Systematization-of-Knowledge paper on the usability of, and communication about, differential privacy.
- Synthesizes insights from studies on both the practical use of DP tools
  and strategies for communicating to practitioners and end-users about DP parameters.

_We Know I Know You Know; Choreographic Programming With Multicast and Multiply Located Values._
CP24 Workshop, 2024, Copenhagen.

_DT-SIM: Property-Based Testing for MPC Security._  
with Joe Near,  
under review by _Digital Threats: Research and Practice_.
[\[pre-print\]](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.04991)  
Demonstrates that property-based testing can be effective for detecting security bugs in secure protocols.

{% include section.html c="Industry" %}

He put [the 402-Receipts Standard](https://www.402receipts.info/introduction.html) on indefinite hiatus in 2019.
Of that work, the piece mostly likely to still be of any use is the [RSA Blind Signature](https://github.com/ShapeOfMatter/RSA-Blind-Signature) implementation.

Mako built a deep understanding of php and python during his six years of industry work; this inspired his decision to return to academia.
